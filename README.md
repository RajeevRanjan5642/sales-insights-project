# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a company supplying computer hardware and peripherals to clients such as Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, etc., operates across India with its head office in Delhi and several regional offices.

The Sales Director of AtliQ Hardware faces significant challenges in a dynamically growing market. Tracking sales performance and understanding business growth trends have become increasingly difficult, especially as overall sales have been declining. With regional managers overseeing North India, South India, and Central India, the Sales Director relies on verbal updates from these managers to gain insights into regional sales performance. However, these verbal reports lack concrete data and fail to provide a comprehensive view of the business, leading to frustration and an inability to make informed, data-driven decisions.

To address this issue, the Sales Director needs a simple data visualization tool that can be accessed daily. Such a tool will enable him to visualize sales data clearly, track regional performance, and make informed decisions to drive business growth.

This project aims to develop a sales-related dashboard using Power BI for AtliQ Hardware. By leveraging this technology, the company can make data-driven decisions that will help increase sales and improve overall business performance.

## Data Analysis using MySQL Workbench

Sales Data is available in the form of SQL database dump.

- Importing data into MySQL Workbench.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42cb1dc1-b4c1-4240-9519-56d7bbefb828)

- Explore each table in the sales database.

      USE sales;
      SELECT * FROM transactions;
      SELECT * FROM customers;
      SELECT * FROM date;
      SELECT * FROM markets;
      SELECT * FROM products;

- Get the total no. of transactions.

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;

- Get the total no. of customers.

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

- Get the total no. of products.

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

- Get the total no. of markets.

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM markets;

- In which different currencies transactions have been made?

      SELECT DISTINCT currency FROM transactions;

- Find the total revenue.

      SELECT SUM(sales_amount) FROM transactions;

- Find total revenue generated in each year.

      SELECT year, SUM(sales_amount) as revenue
      FROM transactions JOIN date
      ON transactions.order_date = date.date
      GROUP BY year;

From the above result we can conclude that the revenue was highest in 2018 and then there has been decreament in revenue in the following years.

- Find total sales quantity in each year.

      SELECT year, SUM(sales_qty)
      FROM transactions JOIN date
      ON transactions.order_date = date.date
      GROUP BY year;

The sales was highest in 2018 and from then there has been decline in sales performance.

- Find total revenue generated by each market and arrange them in decreasing order.

      SELECT markets_code, SUM(sales_amount) as revenue
      FROM transactions
      JOIN markets
      ON transactions.market_code=markets.markets_code
      GROUP BY markets_code
      ORDER BY revenue DESC;

- Find total revenue generated by each zone and arrange them in decreasing order.  

      SELECT zone, SUM(sales_amount) as revenue
      FROM transactions
      JOIN markets
      ON transactions.market_code=markets.markets_code
      GROUP BY zone
      ORDER BY revenue DESC;

  From the above query result we can conclude that north zone generates the highest revenue.

- Find top 5 customers in terms of revenue.

      SELECT custmer_name, SUM(sales_amount) as revenue
      FROM transactions
      JOIN customers
      ON transactions.customer_code=customers.customer_code
      GROUP BY custmer_name
      ORDER BY revenue DESC
      LIMIT 5;

- Find top 5 products in terms of revenue.

      SELECT transactions.product_code, SUM(sales_amount) as revenue
      FROM transactions
      JOIN products
      ON transactions.product_code=products.product_code
      GROUP BY product_code
      ORDER BY revenue DESC
      LIMIT 5;

- Find the total profit margin.

      SELECT SUM(profit_margin) FROM transactions;

- Find total profit margin generated by each market.

      SELECT markets_name,SUM(profit_margin) as total_profit_margin
      FROM transactions
      JOIN markets
      ON transactions.market_code=markets.markets_code
      GROUP BY markets_name
      ORDER BY total_profit_margin DESC;

- Find total profit margin generated by each zone.

      SELECT zone,SUM(profit_margin) as total_profit_margin
      FROM transactions
      JOIN markets
      ON transactions.market_code=markets.markets_code
      GROUP BY zone
      ORDER BY total_profit_margin DESC;

## Data Cleaning / ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

-  Connect MySQL database with Power BI Desktop.
-  After establishing successful connection, we will get a preview of all the tables present in the sales database in our Power BI environment.
-  Click on the transform option and Power Query editor will open.
-  Perform all the transformations using Power Query editor.
   1. markets table : During our analysis we found that the markets table contains some rows with blank zone values. So we filter those rows.
   2. transactions table : During our analysis we found that the transactions table contains
      - 0 and -1 values in sales_amount column for some rows which doesn't make sense. So we filter those rows.
      - two variants of INR and USD i.e. INR and INR#(cr) / USD and USD#(cr). So we decide to replace INR#(cr) with INR and USD#(cr) respectively.
Now, since we need the revenue in INR so we need to convert all the sales_amount present in USD into INR. But the exchange rates vary from year to year. So we duplicate the order_date column and extract year from dates and thus create a year column which we use during the conversion. Now we create a custom column 'norm_sales_amount', using formula, which contains the normalised sales amount.

            if [currency] = "USD" and [year]=2017 then [sales_amount]*64.94
            else if [currency] = "USD" and [year]=2018 then [sales_amount]*70.64
            else if [currency] = "USD" and [year]=2019 then [sales_amount]*72.15
            else if [currency] = "USD" and [year]=2020 then [sales_amount]*74.31
            else [sales_amount]
      - some duplicate rows. So we remove them.

## Data Modelling

## Data Visualization using Power BI

Base measures :
- Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[norm_sales_amount])
- Revenue Contribution % = DIVIDE([Revenue],CALCULATE([Revenue],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
- Sales Qty = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
- Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],[Revenue],0)
- Profit Margin Contribution % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
- Total Profit Margin = SUM('Sales transactions'[Profit_Margin])
